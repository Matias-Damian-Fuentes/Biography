                        On this occasion they have given us the challenge of
                        making one of our first web pages; an autobiography! But,
                        without feeling entirely satisfied, I've decided to go
                        a little bit further, in order to turn it into part of my
                        own portfolio! Like a kind of CV, but with style~

                        I have been in front of a computer since I was
                        four, and since then, I just simply could not stop!
                        <b>It was like my place where I could be just myself,</b> 
                        create, and do all the things that I love. I've been
                        always interested in technology in general; from
                        something so basic as a simple little bit, to something
                        so big and complex as a fully autonomous AI. Things like that drives me crazy! And
                        precisely by things like that, it's why I just simply
                        love being a programmer &lt3, and have planned to learn
                        and apply everything as I can from this world.

                        Bill Gates, Larry Page, Linus Torvalds... Those people
                        are great references for me, and helped me to reach
                        where I'm actually are. People like them are the reason
                        why I always wake up in the morning, make me some nice
                        breakfast, and... just type. Trying always to perform, to push myself,
                        to learn something new... and with that, at the end of
                        the day, be able to create. To contribute. And to make
                        something that, hopefully, one day, changes the world to better. Hopefully one day my code reaches and helps
                        to the people who more need it.

                        I like to have control over things. Take the lead and work
                        as a team! <b>And make sure that everything, from the beginning until the end,
                        works. And works well.</b> The half-done work is not enough for me, and even more
                        important, not enough to satisfy what the client needs.
                        However, I don't consider myself a perfectionist, I know
                        my limits. But I really like the well-done work and be
                        part of it, in every aspect of the entire workflow. That's one of the reasons
                        I decided to be a Full Stack Web Developer!

                        I really love to work on a team, because that's where you learn a lot. When you're alone,
                        and you do everything by yourself aligned by your own perspective, not only you will be
                        overloaded by responsibilities, but also and most importantly I think, it's that you won't have
                        anyone to question your thoughts and how you implement them. We're all humans and make
                        mistakes, and we can learn from them, but the problem is that we don't always realize that
                        we make mistakes. In this world we need each other. <b>Because the teamwork makes the dream work.</b>

                        I always try to perform myself and refine my
                        personality, in order to become a better person in every
                        aspect of my life. When things are not going as well as
                        I would like, often I try to figure it out by myself
                        what I'm doing wrong, and what can I do about it. If I
                        can't handle it by myself, I ask for help on those
                        that I trust, and that I know that they can give me a
                        hand. And if someone is bothered by something that I've
                        done or whatever, <b>I always try to listen to them, understand what it's bothering to them,

                        methodical and aligned with hard sciences as Computer Sciences could be. And, besides that, it's a kind

                            During my career, I took it upon myself to learn the basics of the web development as much as I could. These technologies began to be part of my day to day. You can check it by your own by seeing the source code of this page! Or either, by my projects if you want to. Also I've learned SASS in an Udemy course that I was doing about PHP.

Also, to deploy my apps now with a real database, I had to learn MySQL by my own and migrate all of my backend with it! It was hard work, but also worth it!

With an already prepared API, free plans, and a so intuitive dashboard, Firebase just rocks! And probably I'll use it more often than I've expected!

                        Yep. I've studied at Harvard. And yes, it was rough.
                        Very rough. Obviously I could not study in a
                        presencial way (due to the Coronavirus, location,
                        and, welp, money), but at least I can say that I
                        fulfilled my wish of study in the university of my
                        dreams. The notes, the videos, the projects, even
                        the online classes!! It was incredible to be there
                        and to be part of the class! Despite the fact that the
                        online classes didn't have the same essence and
                        closeness that it would surely have if everything
                        had been given in person, I learned. A lot. And I
                        can truly say that it was worth it.

Maximilian it's the best instructor I've ever had, and with his teachings I've been able to learn, absorb, and master the last technologies that the actual market demands. I wish I had met him before. However, this is only the first step to learn a wide range of languages and technologies, and, hopefully, learn with his teachings!

                        By this time on my career, after I finished my React & Next.js course from <a class="career-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Academind">Academind</a>, I decided to take a look at their YouTube channel. I really enjoyed their course, so, I decided to take a look at their didactic content on YouTube. I ended up on a video explaining what is TypeScript, and why should I use it. At this point I heard a lot about TypeScript, and it has converted on a really popular JavaScript superset, and even though I had a brief knowledge about it and how to use it, I didn't had any deep or professional experience with it. Since with their React & Next.js course I learned pretty much a lot of things about client side rendering but with JavaScript, I decided to take a step forward and learn TypeScript. And now... I just cannot code without it! It's really powerful!

                        On the Cypress & Cucumber course I learned how to create unit tests to ensure that every component that you're testing works and behaves as expected. Also, I learned how to profesionally integrate E2E testings by testing a large number of web applications throughout the entire course and mix them with beauty and useful data-rich dashboards perfect to meet the business standards and requirements, and also talking about businesses, to extend even further the capability for non-technical personal to understand the overview performance of the tests and what each test is and represents on the page, I also can implement the Cucumber framework for a much improved TDD experience.

                            The websites as they scalate sometimes they start to get more and more complex, and sometimes, it can overwhelm the developers. That's why it's of outmost importance to follow the best practices when coding, and especially in a team. That's where Redux comes in. Redux helps you to organize your entire web app state management. However, you must know how to use it and the basic principles of it.

                        I've been here when I was a little younger for like,
                        four years, and, it was amazing! They've teached me
                        a lot of things that I actually know about
                        English. I had to leave it due to the jump
                        to high school. The little time available
                        that I had I preferred to spend it with my friends,
                        and, mainly, due to financial problems. If it hadn't
                        been because I came to this institute, I would probably
                        never had the chance to study at Harvard, since
                        everything is in English, so... I'm really in debt
                        with them. Hopefully I can finish my last year, and finally
                        get graduated!
